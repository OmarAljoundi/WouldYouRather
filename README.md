## About would you rather project
This React App is an implemented version of the 'would you rather' game, after the user signs in, they will land on a page that contains both; the answered questions that contain the percentage of both options, and unanswered questions. After submitting a question answer, it will immediately lead to its result too. The user can create a question that is viewable to all users. Also, check the leaderboard with the rank order of the users, depending on the created and answered questions.
